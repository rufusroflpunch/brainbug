  [ This program prints "Hello World!" and a newline to the screen, its
    length is 106 active command characters [it is not the shortest.]
   
    This loop is a "comment loop", it's a simple way of adding a comment
    to a BF program such that you don't have to worry about any command
    characters. Any ".", ",", "+", "-", "<" and ">" characters are simply
    ignored, the "[" and "]" characters just have to be balanced.
  ]
  +++++ +++               Set Cell #0 to 8
  [
      >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4
      [                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop
          >++             Add 2 to Cell #2
          >+++            Add 3 to Cell #3
          >+++            Add 3 to Cell #4
          >+              Add 1 to Cell #5
          <<<<-           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
      ]                   Loop till Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4
      >+                  Add 1 to Cell #2
      >+                  Add 1 to Cell #3
      >-                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4
      >>+                 Add 1 to Cell #6
      [<]                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will
                          be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop
      <-                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
  ]                       Loop till Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8
   
  The result of this is:
  Cell No :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
  Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
  Pointer :   ^
   
  >>.                     Cell #2 has value 72 which is 'H'
  >---.                   Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 which is 'e'
  +++++++..+++.           Likewise for 'llo' from Cell #3
  >>.                     Cell #5 is 32 for the space
  <-.                     Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a 'W'
  <.                      Cell #3 was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
  +++.------.--------.    Cell #3 for 'rl' and 'd'
  >>+.                    Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
  >++.                    And finally a newline from Cell #6
